Hello contributors, It'z Miles! I'm a casual dev who brings people together through games.

 <img align="left" src="https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/1005875821/63e257af-e3de-4521-86de-25728162fce2" width="40%"> I'm developing Funkin' MINECRAFT. It's a rythm-based platform fighter where you sing, fight, mine, and craft to thwart your foes! Inspired by the strenghts of Friday Night Funkin' and MINECRAFT, gameplay is heavily data-driven with built-in tools for creating custom storylines, characters, songs, and terrain. 
 
The game even has its own website! https://itz-miles.github.io/Funkin-MINECRAFT
It's THE place for news and updates. I use GitHub's CI to deploy native and web builds!
